# Iris Flower Classification with Flask

This project involves deploying a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers using a web-based user interface built with Flask. The application provides predictions based on user input and displays model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The Flask application script.
- `model.pkl`: The saved machine learning model (trained model).
- `model_metrics.json`: The file containing model evaluation metrics.
- `templates/`
  - `index.html`: The HTML template for the user interface.

## Setup and Installation
